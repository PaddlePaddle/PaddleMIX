                broadcasted to `[batch_size, n_head, sequence_length, sequence_length]`.
                When the data type is bool, the unwanted positions have `False`

                int, the unwanted positions have 0 values and the others have 1

                nothing wanted or needed to be prevented attention to. Default None.
        dtype (VarType): The target type of `attn_mask` we expect.
